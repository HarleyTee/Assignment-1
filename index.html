<p> My name is Harley(on the right) and I am from Tasmania, I am an Australian born American/Australian.</P>
<p> I can speak fluent English and patchy Spanish, I have been learning on Duolingo for a long time but have now realised DuoLingo is not particularly effective at becoming fluent in a language.</p>
<p> I have 2 dogs a 3 year old grey hound(Ellie) and an awesome 13 year old Lab(Benji) they are chalk and cheese in terms of personality.</p>
<p> The highest level of study I have reached is a certificate III in Tourism, this led me into my previous job as a Tour leader on the overland track in Tasmania’s World heritage area.</p>
<p> This job has influenced my life in profound ways, getting me out of my shell as a young twenty something lad.
<p> Working as a tour guide has also led me to a point where I am committed to studying the IT pathway, as my hobby when I wasn’t out hiking was computers, not just gaming but learning to code C# in unity(for a game design course that I am still to finish), tinkering with my pc, learning about trends in the IT world and although I can’t afford a VR system, the capabilities of VR not just as a gaming tool but as an interactive learning tool.</p>
<p>In my 12 years of employment I have worked many various physical jobs and am now committed to working in an area a bit more cerebral.</p>

<h2>My interest in IT</h2>
<ul>
  <li>My interest in IT stems from a lifetime of surrounding myself with technology, from my very first rented Nintendo 64 playing on a janky black and white hired TV to my custom gaming PC I have now. I have always enjoyed taking apart and trying to figure out how technology works. I once burned a hole in my carpet on one such “experiment”. I am excited to get into this industry in professional role as there are so many exciting opportunities to learn, from Artificial Intelligence advancements to IT making a positive social change in the world. I would like to see IT used to solved some of the environmental crises that affect our planet.
</li>
  <li>I chose RMIT as it is literally the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology so I assumed it was the go to place for a technological degree. I have also had a few friends that have studied at RMIT previously and they really enjoyed their experience. To be honest from all the universities available through OUA, I thought RMIT was the most suitable as it is physically closer to my home of Tasmanian if I feel the need to study on campus and they were ranked highest when I applied for the course.
</li>
  <li>I expect to learn an exceptional foundation in the Information Technology industry. I am aware that you can not learn everything from books and lectures but they are certainly a great stepping stone to higher studies. Looking the course layout, I am certain that I will be learning about many different aspects of the IT industry and this will help me hone in on what I would like to turn into a career.
</li>
</ul>

<h2> My ideal Job </h2>
<p>In an ideal world, I would like to work for a company like  Blizzard as I have always been a big fan of all the Blizzard universe games. It would be an amazing opportunity to be involved in the next iteration of the series, or maybe even something brand new.</p>
<p>In this ideal world I would see myself in a senior role, either in project management or as a senior engineer. As long as I still get the opportunity to have a hands on role in creation of new content.</p>
<p>The position I have linked here is for a senior software engineer for Blizzards Diablo branch, from what I can gather the role is designed to be a leader of a team.</P>
<p>The role of this team is to improve how Diablo content is created through the use of various software tools.</p>
<p> To apply for this job I would have to acquire a very good understanding of C#, .NET and WFP coding languages. It would help to be proficient at developing, debugging and problem solving both in a coding environment and team management. Blizzard’s main driving force is games and employs people that are excited and passionate about computer games in particular Blizzard computer games.</P>
<p>At this point all I could offer Blizzard would be a passion for their brand, I have been a Blizzard kid since I first started gaming and have completed Diablo 1, 2 and 3 multiple times, spent countless hours in the Warcraft universe and watch many Overwatch Twitch streamers.</P>
<p>I am a motivated person and can inspire those around me to work in an efficient manner while still having a fun time at work.</P>
<p>My plan to obtain the required skill would start with an entry level position within Blizzard and work my way up from there, that combined with the training received from RMIT would put me in a great position to work for Blizzard as I have a passion for games love the Blizzard universe.</p>
<p> As with all jobs if you wish to move your way up the career path you would constantly need to be upgrading your skills. This could mean learning new coding languages, taking seminars on leadership or even just getting hands on experience by learning from your peers</P>
<p> I have attached a <a href="https://careers.blizzard.com/en-us/openings/oe2Uafw4" title="Blizzard Job Application"> link</a> to the original job posting here</P>

<h1> My personality </h2>
<p>I have completed a few tests for this assignment and the results are very intriuging especially the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality"> SMyers-Briggs </a> test. Having never taken the test before it made me look at aspects of my personality in depth. I found the results of the Myers-Briggs test to be surprisingly accurate.</P>
<p>I find the results of the learning style a little off as I feel I learn much better with a hands on approach(tactile) but I feel a balanced learning style is very versatile so that is a benefit. My results are <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=7&V=6&T=7" title="Learning Style Test" ><b>here!</b></a> Feel free to have a look.</p>
<p>IQ test sets me at just at the higher end of average intelligence. Which is nice to know. If you would like to do your own IQ test then click on my score and it will direct you to the website I took my test.</p>
<br><a href="http://www.free-iqtest.net" title="Free IQ Test"><img src="http://www.free-iqtest.net/images/badges2/l126.gif" style="width:200px;height:100px" alt="Free IQ Test" border="0"></a><br>
<p>The results of these tests lend towards small teams or working by myself, which I am known to do, It is something I will have to work on and am willing to put more effort into ‘team behaviour’.
  When forming teams I would look for people that can keep me motivated and are excited to be learning or putting passion into what they are doing. I like to get my work done as soon as possible then fine tune it before the due date as I can’t stand having too much on top of me, it stresses me out and then makes my performance suffer.

<h2> My project idea</h2>
<br>
<h3>Matchmaking app for bush walkers</h3>
<br>

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>I would like to create an app designed to facilitate the painful process of finding people to go on hikes with.</P>
<p> This app will include, a method of communication such as an internal messaging service, I imagine this app to have a social media based system where you can follow fellow hikers and see where they have been. It will include basic maps or information on where to buy more detailed maps of the hike you are planning</P>
<p> I would include contact numbers for the local<abbr title="Parks And Wildlife Service"> PWS </abbr> office closest to your walk. And a short summary of what the walk will be like. I would like this app to be as minimally intrusive as possible and it must have function when out of service.</p>

<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>Having spent years bush walking and hiking throughout the bush I know how important it is to know what you are doing when hiking</P>
<p>This led me to think about a way to connect hikers in a specific app dedicated to hiking.</P>
<p>In my opinion part of the fun of hiking is making friends along the way, and while this is very easy to do on tracks that are popular like the Overland Track, It is not so easy on some of the lesser known tracks in Tas.</P>
<p>This app would facilitate people finding others who love hiking to connect and get out into the bush together.</P>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This app would have in its final stage many different features.</p>
<p>My general idea of how a user would use the app would be to download it from an app store like Google or Apple, sign up to an account, putting your hiking experience, preferences and a little bit about yourself in a profile.
<p>The next step would have the user show interest in a particular walk buy likng it(I would like to have some different variation of a classic thumbs up). This would show everyone on the app that you are interested in doing this hike and whether you would like to meet up with people.</P>
<p>From there people could contact you through the app’s messaging system and the ‘team’ could figure out a suitable date.</p>


<h4>Other features in the app could have a party based job distribution system such as:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Who is going to cook the food for which night.</li>
  <li>What food are people buying be it dehydrated food or actual meals.</li>
  <li>Method of transport to and from the hike. If the hike was a circuit then you could carpool and save money on petrol, or if it was a linear trail then the team could organise to have a car at either end.</li>
</ul>
<p>This app would also have weather statistics from previous years(which I would somehow collect from <abbr title="Bureau Of Meteorology">BOM</abbr>), and a real time forecast for the particular area you are hiking in would be integrated into the app.</P>
<p>Using my knowledge of Tasmanian wilderness I would include track notes on what the track was like and what you would be expecting to encounter in the bush from snakes to wild weather to what flowers were flowering at that time.</P>
<p>This information would be from my own experience/research initially and after a decent user base the information could be crowd sourced through comments on the hike from walkers.</P>
<p>It would be awesome if in the future this could be integrated with<abbr title="Parks And Wildlife Service"> PWS </abbr>so if there are any closures or warnings like bushfires or heavy snowfall then you would get push alerts to your phone(if they are enabled) ahead of time.</P>
<p>Another feature would be to have GPS tracking built into the app so you could see where you hiked and how long you travelled. This could be put onto a digital map of the area so you get a rough idea of what the next few days of hiking will entail.</P>
<p>I imagine this app to be very clean and neat with 0 to minimal advertising, no in app purchases to unlock new content and free.</P>
<p> At the end of a hike you could comment on how your trip was and let<abbr title="Parks And Wildlife Service"> PWS </abbr>know if there was anything that needed attending to such as heaters or huts breaking, fallen trees that need clearing, or just that you loved the hike and would indeed recommend this app to a friend.
<p>My app would take the hassle out of organising a hiking trip with friends and potentially make it easy to create life long hike buddies.</p>

<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
<p>Having no actual knowledge of how to develop an app I would need to learn that first off. Then after getting on my way with that, learn how to utilise what information is already out there from PWS and other hiking sites.</p>
<p>I have a minimal knowledge of coding and app development but hopefully by the time this Bachelor is complete I have all the skills required to make an amazing app.</P>

 <h4>Skills Required</h4>
 <ul>
   <li>Coding, This would be a huge part of me being able to develop this app. As at this stage I have very basic knowledge of how to code, I do enjoy what I have created so far in unity but to develop an app is a much bigger undertaking and would require some more training. Which this bachelor should teach me.</li>
   <li>Business Ownership, having owned a business with my beautiful wife for the last year and a half I feel we(as a team) have a solid grasp on how to manage a business.</li>
   <li>Development of the app, having no knowledge of how to develop and create an app, that is one area where I would need to work on. But this course should hopefully help with that.</li>
 </ul>

<h4>Outcome</h4>
<p>If the project is successful, I will have at the very least connected some keen bush walkers with like minded people, at best I could be the new ‘social media app’ for bush walking.</P>
<p>It is unrealistic to think that I will be able to do this on my own in the short amount of time we have in this course(9 weeks now) but it is not unrealistic to think I could at least make a start by designing a part of the app.</p>
<p>Hopefully this app is successful in getting more people into the wilderness to reconnect with nature and take some time out for themselves as I believe this is very important.</p>
